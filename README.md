# 2 Ways of running CigCraft:

1. Installing it with the CigCraft Puffer template (Soon)

      - Still working on the complete Puffer template
  
      - for now the best way of running it in Puffer is to use a discord.py template with the .env filled out, and reqirements

2. Run the main file as it is

      - install python, and the requrements inside the requirements.txt

      - fill out the .env file with the righ information
  
      - run the program

This page is still work in progress!

Im open for ideas and improvements
