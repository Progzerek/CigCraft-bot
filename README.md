# CigCraft-bot
A discord bot for controlling minecraft server trough Puffer Panel!

2 Ways of running CigCraft:

1. Installing it with the CigCraft Puffer template (Soon)

2. Run the main file as it is
     Make sure you fill out the .env file with the right infromations



This page is still work in progress, planing to make a Puffer template for it, but you can still use it with a discord.py template

Im open for ideas and improvements
